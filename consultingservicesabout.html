<h1>Autonomous Robots </h1>

        <p>An autonomous robot is a robot that performs behaviors or tasks with a high degree of autonomy. Autonomous robotics is usually considered to be a subfield of artificial intelligence, robotics, and information engineering.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">Autonomous robots are particularly desirable in fields such as spaceflight, household maintenance (such as cleaning), waste water treatment, and delivering goods and services. 
Some modern factory robots are "autonomous" within the strict confines of their direct environment. It may not be that every degree of freedom exists in their surrounding environment, but the factory robot's workplace is challenging and can often contain chaotic, unpredicted variables. The exact orientation and position of the next object of work and (in the more advanced factories) even the type of object and the required task must be determined. This can vary unpredictably (at least from the robot's point of view). </p>

        Immersion into virtual reality is a perception of being physically present in a non-physical world. The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images, sound or other stimuli that provide an engrossing total environment. .</p>
        <p class="mb-0">An immersive digital environment is an artificial, interactive, computer-created scene or "world" within which a user can immerse themselves.[11] 
        Immersive digital environments could be thought of as synonymous with virtual reality, but without the implication that actual "reality" is being simulated. An immersive digital environment could be a model of reality, but it could also be a complete fantasy user interface or abstraction, as long as the user of the environment is immersed within it. . </p>

        <p> A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. .</p>
        <p class="mb-0">Blockchain was invented by a person using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server.The bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains which are readable by the public are widely used by cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is considered a type of payment rail.Private blockchains have been proposed for business use.</p>
